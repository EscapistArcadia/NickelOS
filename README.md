NickelOS is/will be an operating system kernel supporting multiple architectures (e.g., x86, x86_64, arm, risc-v, etc.) and multiple file systems (fat, ext, etc.). Currently, courses I took on campus taught single-processor systems and kernel programming, while I'd like to explore kernel and system programming on multiprocessor systems. During the winter break, I found multiprocessor systems make the system programming much much much more complicated.

For update and maintainance, I currently do not want to update it in this document, since I'm not very familiar with the markdown format. I will update the status at here: [https://escapist.notion.site/NickelOS-163ebc30a9388029aae0e65d7b7ef6f2](https://escapist.notion.site/NickelOS-163ebc30a9388029aae0e65d7b7ef6f2) (same to the link above). You can see the part(s) I'm currently working on, the part(s) I've got stuck and not resolved, and some addition notes regarding this kernel.
